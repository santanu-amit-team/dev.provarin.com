          <p class="text-uppercase">SECTION 8 - TEXT MESSAGE PROGRAM DETAILS</p>
          <p>
            PROVARIN offers subscription text message programs (also known as
            subscription SMS programs). Visitors to Provarin.com may enroll in
            these programs in a variety of ways; for example, by texting a
            specific keyword to a mobile short code, or by filling out and
            submitting a form on Provarin.com. New methods are added regularly.
            No matter how you enroll, you always have the ability to opt out of
            these types of programs. Message frequency varies.
          </p>

          <p>
            PROVARIN also offers one-time text messages. For these one-time text
            messages, you will not be enrolled in any subscription text message
            program (unless you separately opt in to one or more such programs).
            Individuals may text a keyword (e.g., HEALTH, WELL, HEART, etc.) to
            one of our short codes and receive one-time information on a certain
            topic.
          </p>

          <p>
            PROVARIN is committed to building user trust and confidence by
            promoting and complying with the use of business practices that help
            protect the privacy of our visitors and customers and their data.
            For more information, you can view a copy of our privacy policy by
            clicking here. PROVARIN does not sell mobile opt-in lists.
          </p>

          <p>
            PROVARIN does not charge you separately for any of our subscription
            text message programs or one-time text messages (we do charge for
            PROVARIN products, the costs of which are functionally separate from
            our text message programs). However, message and data rates may
            apply from your mobile carrier. Subject to the terms and conditions
            of your mobile carrier, you may receive text messages sent to your
            mobile phone. Participation in PROVARIN text message programs are
            standard rated (no premium content).
          </p>

          <p>
            By providing your consent to participate in our text message
            programs, you approve any such charges from your mobile carrier.
            Charges for text messages may appear on your mobile phone bill or be
            deducted from your prepaid balance. PROVARIN reserves the right to
